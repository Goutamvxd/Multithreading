1= What is synchronized keyword where we can appply?
Ans:	Modifier applicable for methods,blocks,but not for variables and classes.

2= Explain advantage of synchronized keyword
Ans:	we can resolve data inconsistency problems

3= Explain disadvantage of synchronized keywrd?
Ans:	It increases waiting time of thread and creates performance problems

4=	What is race condition?
	If multiple threads are operationg simultaneously on same java object then there may be a chance of data inconsistency problem this is called race condition.

we can over come this problem by using synchronized keyword

5=	What is object lock and when it is equired
Ans:	Every object in java has a unique lock which is nothing but object level lock.

When ever a thread want's to execute instnace synchronized method , then the thread require object level lock

6= What is class level lock and when it is required?
Ans:	Every class in java has a unique lock which is nothing but class level lock

When ever if a thread want's to execute static synchronized method then the thread require this class level lock

7= Class level lock v/s Object level lock
Ans:	class level lock
	----------------
	thread want's to execute static synchronized method then class level lock required

---------------------
	object level lock
	---------------
Thread want's to execute instance synchronized methd
then object level lock is requied

8=	While a thread executing synchronized method on the given object, is the remaining threads are allowed to execute any other synchronized method simultaneously on the same object

Ans :NO


9= whats is synchronized block in java 
Ans:	A synchronized block of code is a block of code that is only executed by one thread at a time, preventing data races and ensuring that critical sections of code are accessed in a thread-safe manner.

10= How to declare synchronized block,to get lock of current object
Ans:	synchronized(this){
	}

11= How to declare synchronized block to get class level lock
Ans:	synchronized(className.class){

	}

12=	What is the advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method
Ans:	Performance by default will be improved
	waiting times of thread will be reduced


13= Is a thread can acquire multiple lock simultaneously
Ans:	YES

class X{
public synchronized void m1(){ // here thread has lock on x object
	
Y y=new Y();  

synchronized (y){
	//here thread has locks of X and Y


	Z z=new Z();
	synchronized(z){
	//here thread has locks of x,y,z
	}
	}
	}
}


X x=new X();
x.m1();
--------------------------------------
A thread can acquire multiple locks simultaneously from different objects

14=	Whatis synchronized statement?
Ans:	The statments present in synchronized methods and statement present in synchronized block. are called synchronized statements
